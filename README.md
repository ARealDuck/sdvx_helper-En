This is a form of the orignal SDVX_Helper program by DJ_Kata found here: https://github.com/dj-kata/sdvx_helper 
This fork of the program is purely for translating the current version to plain American english and is not meant for use
When this project is finished I will send a request for the translated version to be added to the original project and this project will solely exist to keep up with the updates the DJ_Kata puts out
I do plan on doing more once this project is finished but will stay unannounced till then

EDIT: Now that the main function is now completed. Testing for the main test build has started. Once this test phase finishes and no bugs have shown, I will most likely be putting much less time into maintaining this project.
As much as I would like to keep maintaining this project and enhancing it for the main build, I have a lot on my plate already and I would like to get back to my Japanese language studies. 
That doesnt mean im going to be completely gone however, if I find the time and energy to put into this project again, I'll get more work done on it. Until then any person is more than welcome to help contribute to the project in their own way.
If you wish to help maintain this project, please get in contact with me @ https://discord.gg/rTt6z5hp6t

Thanks!
